#HI! it's great to see that you're reading this, i put my heart and soul into this project and it is really nice that people are finally seeing this.
# if you any suggestions or just really like this project, do let me know. Afterall, collaboration is way to success!
# i would recommend you to install Pycharm along pytesseract,gTTs and opencv to run it smoothly. opencv is a bit neccesary(see the pycharm file)
# apart from that, i dont have to much to say so enjoy exploring!
